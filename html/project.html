      <h2 class="tophead">Project</h2>
      <p>
        When our group decided to suggest creating a project which incorporates different aspects of ALL our individuals 
        ideas in assignment 1, we spent a significant portion of a group meeting attempting to all agree on the outcome,
        with individuals disagreeing on the expectation or overarching involvement and dependency of coding, or for example 
        the simplicity of the suggested project prompt. These disagreements and deliberations eventually led to the group 
        selecting Stephen’s ‘Performance Tracking Glasses’, as it had met the most or at least one of the group requirements 
        for each individual within the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        These specifications ranged from the involvement of coding using things such as javascript and IOS/Android app 
        launchers/development tools to produce the apps, as specified by both Stephen and Daniel. To things such as the 
        creation/design of UI, and the necessity of data stores and collection, as brought up by Ella and William respectively. 
        These Performance Tracking Glasses (PTG) refers to the creation of a both a physical and software product, by which 
        individuals will have the ability to track and monitor their performance based on pre-existing software tools such as 
        google maps. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifications and details of the Service (Old specifications with minimal elaboration):</br>
        This project requires the creation of glasses with UI compatible lenses (which exist), which will allow the user to 
        select what will be displayed on each frame (separate, independant lenses) based on their needs. These glasses will 
        be based around bluetooth connectivity, by which as the user completes tasks it will transmit the data (performance) 
        to the app on the users phone or smart watch(co-dependant), to provide direct and real time feedback based on a query 
        of results preset by the system (base data that the user enters and the expectations they want to meet when creating 
        a profile for the app). 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, while a service such as this would be amazing, there are a variety of limitations to such a project, that will 
        require an extensive amount of time or a substitution/ change to the original view. For example, how will the device be 
        charged if the design calls for the use of bluetooth connectivity, if a battery is used how will that affect the final 
        design or will the application be entirely online, preventing the use the product (or some features) as the data stores 
        requires access by the user to complete comparisons of the user data and accumulated users data. These are just some up 
        a few of the ideas and questions our team brought up and discussed, providing the new outline for the PTG.
      </p>
      <p>It will include: (group deliberation and points):
        <ul>
          <li>Bluetooth connectivity to the application on the smart device, as it will be the easiest way to allow the device 
            to connect, without forcing the user to rely on a cabled connection, which would not only minimise the devices that 
            could be connected to the phone and or smart watch (it also doesn't look good having a cable wrapping up from your 
            pocket or hand to the glasses frame).</li>
          <li>Due to the fact that this device was created to be a bluetooth dependant device, the glasses frame would need to 
            be modified in such a way as to allow for battery space, allowing for the device to stay active for at least 2 hours 
            minimum before recharge.</li>
          <li>A UI intensity adjustment wheel which can be found on the glasses frame, meaning that the user can change the 
            brightness of the display on the fly.</li>
          <li>ALL display options (display choices for the UI) will need to be selected and set from an interface tab/ screen in 
            the application.</li>
          <li>The application will require the user to have a WIFI/4G connection to access the features of the app, as the data 
            and info will be stored on the companies servers (possibly a cloud service or a server side data store).</li>
          <li>The glasses frame (the hook that goes around the ears) will contain wireless earphone tech that will allow the user 
            to not only access the application and track performance, but also allow the user to select and listen to music.</li>
        </ul>
