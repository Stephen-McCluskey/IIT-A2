      <h2 class="nobox tophead">Assignment 3: Project Plan</h2>
      <h2 class="tophead">Topic</h2>
      <p>Our group ‘VibeCheck’ has decided to move forward with the initial proposal of the HUDFitness glasses from Stephen’s
        Assignment 1, and ‘VibeChecks’ Assignment 2. Our group VibeCheck had chosen this project for a multitude of reasons
        ranging from AR’s yet to be fully explored market opportunities, to things such as how cool it’ll be to own a technology
        such as this. However, we at VibeCheck ultimately value and hold our desire to develop, research and commercialise the 
        HUDFitness to our wish to provide cheap and affordable AR technology (ranging from simple to high Standard) to everyone at
        a price equivalent to that of prescription glasses, and while a pursuit such as this is currently far-fetched due to the
        monetary implications, a yet to be fully discovered market such as this can have a huge impact on the fitness industry.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, the VibeCheck team also aspires to not only produce the AR capable services for the fitness industry, but also
      wishes to in future expand the potential consumers of the glasses by diversifying, and building on the abilities of the AR
      glasses to be used in scenarios other than ones that are fitness related. We wish to provide future consumers the ability
      to display and track any and all tasks they do, ranging from the initial fitness direction VibeCheck has taken, to things such 
      as the food, construction and even military scene. This is ultimately our end goal at VibeCheck, as providing an AR service 
      which could assist in everyday life ranging from physical activities to cooking or even work related things, serves our goal
      to provide a service that could be sold at a commercial level at reasonable prices. 
      </p>
     <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>Originally this project was chosen to serve as a filler until such time as our group had decided on another idea. However, 
        upon delving deeper into the HUDFitness proposal, we found that this technology is currently not fully explored and AR’s
        potential future within a modernised society could be limitless in terms of not only monetary, but also design and development
        opportunities. This sudden interest expressed by our group came from this potentially limitless market, by which consumers
        will have the ability to track, and augment any task/ statistic that they may wish to accomplish. 
      </p>
      <p>This kind of virtual tracking assistance isn't that far-fetched in terms of the market either, with a small handful of
        companies (primarily large, well established one such as apple and microsoft) striving towards the production of AR capable
        solutions for their pre-existing software, such as but not limited to the implementation of maps, car speed and gear 
        monitoring, and even the implementation of AR within a variety of shopping situations. Through this it is easy to see that
        VibeCheck wishes to provide a performance-tracking service to individuals within the fitness industry, and possibly in the
        future provide a more well-rounded and beneficial day-to-day AR service that falls in line with current IT trends expressed 
        by more established companies.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, if we had the ability to successfully produce a technology such as this with all the features expressed within
        the design listed below, it would not only demonstrate the ability to work well with and understand coding at a professional
        level (due to the extensive need to produce an ever changing and customisable UI and the need to connect the display tracked
        information with the preset software algorithms of the programs it will be requiring for function.), but also demonstrates to
        an employer our ability to dedicate our time, and strive toward a goal with all intent of producing a service which falls into
        standards that were preset by the groups goals.
      </p>
      <h2>Landscape</h2>
      <p>
        In terms of competition, the market for AR glasses has a relatively small range of products (most of which are currently in their development phase). Despite the small size of the market, the competitors manage to pack in quite a large variety of products. There are a few main categories which define the parameters of the AR glasses market at the moment. We have analysed glasses based on price, processing, display, style, controls and target market. Not all of the AR glasses discussed have been released yet, so some of the specifications are merely speculation at this stage. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting with price, Apple Glass surprisingly comes in with one of the lowest in the market, at a projected USD 499.[1] The Kopin SOLOS will also set users back USD 499.[2] Prices vary from there, with the Vuzix Blade Smart Glasses, North’s Focals and the Epson BT-300 Smart Glasses all coming below USD 1000.[3][4][5] Toshiba’s dynaEdge costs USD 1899.[6] However, the most expensive model by far is Microsoft’s HoloLens 2, at USD 3500.[7] While this price jump may seem exorbitant, it is not unjustified, as we will discuss below. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Processing styles vary between the glasses. The HoloLens is one of the few AR Glasses to feature onboard processing, which allows for much faster computing and potentially offering a vastly improved user-experience.[7] Several models make use of phone connectivity - for example, the Apple Glass is reported to rely on users having an iPhone close at hand for use, much like their Apple Watch. This means they will most likely require a Wi-Fi connection, as Bluetooth speeds may not be able to handle the data transfer required for AR.[1] In a different approach, dynaEdge runs off a ‘pocket PC’ which, as the name suggests, is designed to sit in the wearer’s pocket.[6] 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also different styles of display. Firstly, it is important to make the distinction between heads-up display and true AR. With heads-up display, information is generally projected in front of the user’s field of view. With AR, the display ‘interacts’ with the user’s field-of-view - that is, the user’s view is incorporated into the display, and displayed elements are positioned and sized relative to real objects. Some reports claim that models such as the dynaEdge, Intel’s Vaunt and the Google Glass can only really be categorized under heads-up display.[6][8][9] Most other models are examples of actual AR. In terms of the display methods, many (including the HoloLens, Epson BT-300 Smart Glasses, SOLOS and the Vuzix Blade) use a holographic style, where images are projected onto the lens of the glasses.[2][3][5][7] The HoloLens has one of the best displays, with a 42˚ field of view and 47ppi resolution.[7] On the other hand, while the display method of the Apple Glass is as-of-yet unreleased, they have patented a ‘catadioptric lens’ which projects images directly on the lens of the wearer’s eyes, with the help of eye-tracking.[10] Intel’s Vaunt also projects images directly onto the user’s retina.[8] This could lead to unparalleled field of view and resolution.
      </p>
      <p> 
        In terms of style - that is, the aesthetic design - the market for AR glasses sees a very large variety. The styling highlights the different focuses of companies when designing their glasses. North, a Canadian-based company, has taken the most discrete approach. Their holographic Focals are designed to look exactly like ordinary glasses.[4] Intel’s Vaunt glasses are going for the same goal, and weigh in at only 50g.[8] At the other end of the spectrum, the HoloLens weighs in at 566g.[7] This is due to its onboard computing - it has to carry a lot more than other models which rely on a phone. It also has a very bulky band with two rests to cushion the unit against the wearer’s head, to help cope with the large weight.[7] The BT-300 Smart Glasses are also quite obtrusive - they are able to sit over normal glasses - and they look more like a piece of futuristic technology than a pair of normal glasses.[5]
      </p>
      <p>
        Different companies have gone with different methods for their controls. The dynaEdge is designed with a small touch sensor on the display unit, and several buttons on its ‘pocket PC’.[6] Several models choose to go with a trackpad style control - the BT-300 Smart Glasses have a remote-looking device which is actually attached to the glasses.[5] On the other hand, Intel’s Vaunt can be controlled with eye gestures - for example, sweeping the eyes to the right to dismiss a notification.[7] Vuzix have gone for both trackpad and voice control with their Blade glasses.[3] The most inconspicuous control comes from North - as one of their main goals is to create a very discrete experience, they have chosen to use the Amazon Echo Loop Smart Ring, so users can control the glasses without making distracting movements.[4]
      </p>
      <p>
        The final category we are looking at is the target market. Kopin’s SOLOS has the most similar target market to the original iteration of our HUDFitness glasses. SOLOS is aimed at cyclists, runners and triathletes - it displays performance markers, such as distance, time, speed and heart rate, as well as allowing for phone calls, navigation and listening to music.[2] Some products are aimed at professionals only, such as the Google Glass or the dynaEdge, which are aimed at surgeons and manufacturers,[6][9] or the Vuzix Blade, which is aimed at construction managers.[3] Some companies, such as Intel, are taking a different approach. As of yet, Intel’s Vaunt does not have a target market - they are simply designing the technology to provide a new platform for developers to work with, and are waiting to see what direction they will take.[7]
      </p>
      <p>
        The HUD Glasses don’t necessarily introduce any new features to the market, but we aim to combine the features in such a way that we are able to achieve both high functionality and a minimally-intrusive design.

      <h2>Aim and Goals</h2>
      <p> The ultimate aim of VibeChecks project is to not only produce and provide an AR service to consumers on a commercial level,
        at an affordable price in comparison to that of the AR tech currently in circulation (view above for competitive prices), 
        but to normalise the use of AR within individual everyday life. Although currently AR is very expensive and out of reach for
        individuals who aren't willing to pay upwards of $500 + for a simple/limited function tech (these technologies can jump up to
        $10000+ if you decide to allow another company to work on and develop your tech for you),  by commercialising this product
        and keeping the product within a price range similar to that of prescription glasses, it serves the groups aim to implement AR
        within a range of daily tasks that individuals/consumers could benefit from, at a price range that consumers would be more
        willing to purchase the product at.
      </p>
      <p>Goal 1: reduce the overall price of AR tech Our group strives to drastically reduce the price of AR tech while still maintaining the integrity of the services. By doing this, it
        serves our groups aim to normalise this tech, instigating more sales to a wider census than excessive pricing which aims to 
        serve a small tech savvy consumer group. This desire for our group to utilise cheaper prices for high end products not only
        aims to assist the introduction of AR capable technologies from being used and implemented, but also acts as a drive for
        competitors to produce greater more updated tech at more reasonable prices. 
      </p>
      <p>Goal 2: increase the functionality of the HUDFitness tech to a point that they are beneficial in areas other than fitness.
        Another goal our group discussed is the idea of future expansion of the initial project idea to better implement areas other
        than the fitness industry we have currently limited our project to. The notion of future expansion was brought up earlier on
        within our discussions, when we talked about competitors and potential avenues of AR in which they or we could take/ implement 
        into future designs if we had the ability to produce this product. Some such ideas included (but weren’t limited to) supplying
        HUD with the ability to act as a virtual navigator, used in cooking (displaying recipes and ingredients in real time.) or even
        across things such as construction and interior design. The directions in which the HUD glasses can be taken allows for a lot
        of avenues in which our glasses can be taken when targeting new census groups and consumers.
      </p>
      <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
      <p>The project decided upon by the VibeCheck team was the AR supported glasses which we had named HUDFitness. Our acronym HUD
        comes from Heads Up Display. After a lot of deliberation and drawbacks the final outcome (currently) decided upon by our team
        includes the creation of the HUDFitness glasses as an accessory to a phone application which would allow the user to dictate
        a multitude of things the glasses are capable of. Some of these functions include but are not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The intensity of the display (presets in the app) </li>
        <li>What information the display will show.</li>
        <li>Whether or not notification features should be enabled</li>
        <li>What notifications will be shown on the display at any given time</li>
        <li>Plot Routes and allow users the capability to see routes created by other user(if the other user decides to share the route)</li>
        <li>Track progress and allow the user to display PB (themselves and others</li>
        <li>Displaying average speed and projected speeds in comparison to other users data</li>
        <li>The estimated intensity of there fitness (current session)</li>
        <li>Advice on how much the glasses user needs to either pick up or lower the pace depending on the data collected from other user of the VR tech</li>
        <li>A front facing camera by which users have the ability to record things and take pictures. (users will have full control of whether it is on or off)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Basically the app will allow the user to customise the experience of their Glasses. Alongside the creation of the app and
        the HUD glasses lenses, our group has decided to allot the glasses as an accessory via bluetooth connectivity, by which it
        will also allow users to access apps that support AR tech in future, such as music, maps, etc once the apple glasses come out.
        And finally the UI will be created using a laser projection, and the glasses will contain photopolymer materials which will
        allow display the info being transmitted in AR in 2D. (see more details below about other tools added to the device)
      </p>
      <p>However, a project such as this has taken months of preparation to design and plan for, and yet all we currently have is
        concepts and ideas for what the glasses that we are planning to create will be capable of doing. The concept of the HUDFitness
        glasses came from Stephen’s dad, who mentioned he’d like a set of glasses which would be able to measure his speed and his 
        time when going out, as it would relieve him of carrying a phone when cycling and running. After receiving the pitch from
        his dad, Stephen designed the first initial HUDFitness prototype which had a few of the design qualities of the current end 
        product, ranging from the bluetooth connectivity, and reliancy of the app in conjunction to the functioning of the glasses.
      </p>
      <p>After that, the design for the HUDFitness glasses was revised by the newly created ‘VibeCheck’ Team within the 2nd Assignment.
        Through numerous discussions and deliberations about possible avenues in which the glasses could be taken down in terms or 
        advancements and additives to the initial design it was still kept relatively similar to that of the initial design created in
        A2, however more hardware was added to further bolster the few capabilities it had, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the implementation of an improved battery inside which would allow it to last for a minimum of 4 hours before the device would need to be recharged</li>
        <li>The UI’s intensity changing capabilities found on the app has been moved to the glasses frame allowing for on the fly changing (brighter intensity means faster depletion)</li>
        <li>The framework for music connectivity and playing was mentioned, and implemented so that it would be available once iOS, android and other phone systems make their applications AR compatible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And finally during the final discussions of the possible solutions and functionality we could add to bolster the final product
        in a market soon to be competitive (many large companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft are releasing their own AR glasses),
        we had decided to add the following features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Presets can be set on the accompanying application, which will allow the use rto create presets for multiple wearers or even just for different condition/ times of day.</li>
        <li>Front facing camera to allow users to take pictures and even record short video clips that will be stored on the users phone in which the HUDFitness glasses will be connected to. (this feature is completely controlled by the user as to prevent any issues which may be connotated with an invasion of privacy).</li>
        <li>Potential for eye-tracking functionality - both to optimise display, and, more excitingly, as a potential control mechanism. If the eye-tracking technology reached a viable level, users could use gestures such as ‘swiping’ their eyes across the display to control the phone.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although we at VibeCheck wish the best for the potential consumers of such a product, there are a variety of software and 
        hardware functions that we have added which have the possibility of raising concern over things such as privacy. These features
        include the glasses ability to store and use data in a mass collection to provide statistics to other users based on the users
        details such as age and activity levels, and the front facing camera. To essentially kill 2 birds with one stone, users of 
        this product will be able to opt out of both of these services upon setup of the, and installation of the application on the
        users phone. And even if you accidentally allowed the HUDFitness share data and record clips/take pictures, these can be
        opted out within the applications settings. Moreover, even if you opt into the services provided, ALL pictures and recordings
        will be kept and shared on your devices, we don't receive anything. Also if you opt into sharing info (age group and activity
        level), ALL the info is depersonalised and kept anonymous. 
      </p>
      <h2>Scopes and Limits</h2>
      <p>The biggest limiting factor for such a technology is the cost of manufacturing of this new technology, and while we at
        VibeCheck wish to minimise the expenses of the consumer in the long run, this may take a multitude of years due to the multitude
        of factors affecting the development of such innovative technology. These factors include the platform and business model in
        which the AR solution will run on, which has been documented to range from $50,000 - $2.5 million in extreme gaming cases for
        the products creator. This kind of pricing requires companies to sell the products at a higher price to just break even,
        meaning that the $500 + price tag we are currently seeing for the AR lenses today will remain until such time as the 
        development prices decrease (they will decrease once the technology becomes mandatory in for working class citizens and is no
        longer considered new and innovative).
      </p>
      <p>For the AR capable glasses to work it requires the use of a laser display (similar to that of the current HUD displays used
        in cars) that will pass the displayed images across the lens’  photopolymer material that will display the images being 
        transmitted by the light. This is more of  a limit to the abilities of the hardware currently in use, as there is no UI lens 
        capable of just displaying information without an input display function.
      </p>
      <p>The HUDFitness glasses will be limited to that of an accessory item which will complement the user phone, and only work in
        conjunction with the app to operate the glasses display. But a tech that could be used to create a less dependant feel to the
        glasses would be the creation of a technology similar to that of a ‘Starboard’, which is a tool developed by apple (a little
        panel on the side of the glasses which allows the user to use gestures when trying to perform specific functions. But a tool
        like this would take a long time to develop and implement, especially with a team of only 4 working on it.
      </p>
      <p>The main material used within this product will most likely be plastic as metal only serves to increase the cost of production,
        and ultimately the price the consumer would need to pay.
      </p>
      <p>The glasses won't be able to remain fully function for an extended period of time as the glasses won't be connected via cable 
        rather bluetooth, meaning the user will need to charge the glasses before use, and the glasses should be able to function for
        a minimum of 4 hours (with the first releases, but will continually get better and last longer).
      </p>
      
      <h2>Assignment 2 Plan</h2>
      <p>
        When our group decided to suggest creating a project which incorporates different aspects of ALL our individuals 
        ideas in assignment 1, we spent a significant portion of a group meeting attempting to all agree on the outcome,
        with individuals disagreeing on the expectation or overarching involvement and dependency of coding, or for example 
        the simplicity of the suggested project prompt. These disagreements and deliberations eventually led to the group 
        selecting Stephen’s ‘Performance Tracking Glasses’, as it had met the most or at least one of the group requirements 
        for each individual within the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        These specifications ranged from the involvement of coding using things such as javascript and IOS/Android app 
        launchers/development tools to produce the apps, as specified by both Stephen and Daniel. To things such as the 
        creation/design of UI, and the necessity of data stores and collection, as brought up by Ella and William respectively. 
        These Performance Tracking Glasses (PTG) refers to the creation of a both a physical and software product, by which 
        individuals will have the ability to track and monitor their performance based on pre-existing software tools such as 
        google maps. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifications and details of the Service (Old specifications with minimal elaboration):</br>
        This project requires the creation of glasses with UI compatible lenses (which exist), which will allow the user to 
        select what will be displayed on each frame (separate, independant lenses) based on their needs. These glasses will 
        be based around bluetooth connectivity, by which as the user completes tasks it will transmit the data (performance) 
        to the app on the users phone or smart watch(co-dependant), to provide direct and real time feedback based on a query 
        of results preset by the system (base data that the user enters and the expectations they want to meet when creating 
        a profile for the app). 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, while a service such as this would be amazing, there are a variety of limitations to such a project, that will 
        require an extensive amount of time or a substitution/ change to the original view. For example, how will the device be 
        charged if the design calls for the use of bluetooth connectivity, if a battery is used how will that affect the final 
        design or will the application be entirely online, preventing the use the product (or some features) as the data stores 
        requires access by the user to complete comparisons of the user data and accumulated users data. These are just some up 
        a few of the ideas and questions our team brought up and discussed, providing the new outline for the PTG.
      </p>
      <p>It will include: (group deliberation and points):
        <ul>
          <li>Bluetooth connectivity to the application on the smart device, as it will be the easiest way to allow the device 
            to connect, without forcing the user to rely on a cabled connection, which would not only minimise the devices that 
            could be connected to the phone and or smart watch (it also doesn't look good having a cable wrapping up from your 
            pocket or hand to the glasses frame).</li>
          <li>Due to the fact that this device was created to be a bluetooth dependant device, the glasses frame would need to 
            be modified in such a way as to allow for battery space, allowing for the device to stay active for at least 2 hours 
            minimum before recharge.</li>
          <li>A UI intensity adjustment wheel which can be found on the glasses frame, meaning that the user can change the 
            brightness of the display on the fly.</li>
          <li>ALL display options (display choices for the UI) will need to be selected and set from an interface tab/ screen in 
            the application.</li>
          <li>The application will require the user to have a WIFI/4G connection to access the features of the app, as the data 
            and info will be stored on the companies servers (possibly a cloud service or a server side data store).</li>
          <li>The glasses frame (the hook that goes around the ears) will contain wireless earphone tech that will allow the user 
            to not only access the application and track performance, but also allow the user to select and listen to music.</li>
        </ul>
