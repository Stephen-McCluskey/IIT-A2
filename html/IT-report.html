        <h3>What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            Stephens ideal job Software Development was the highest in rank among the group members sitting at 20th out of 201 
            in the data set provided with 337 job posting within the year that’s an avg of 0.93 a day. </br></br>
            The runner up was Ella and Daniel’s with Senior Front-end developer ranking 23rd out of 201 and the number of job 
            postings reflect this being a 303 within a year average making in only a 0.1 difference at 0.83 jobs posted per day.</br></br>
            Last was William’s with his ideal job in Data Science which did not appear on this data set the nearest equivalent
            being Data Engineer which was 39th out of 201 with only 182 job postings within the year that is an abysmally 
            average of 0.49 job postings per day.</br></br>
          </p>
        <h3>Set of skills required for the applicable job titles</h3>
          <p>
          </p>
        <h3>Do these results (skill requirements/ranking) affect your job choice?</h3>
          <p>
            None of our opinions on our ideal jobs have changed due to the fact that all of us mainly chose our 
            ideal jobs with a focus of ideal workplace environment and the type of work we want to achieve and not based 
            on workplace security and workforce statistics  
          </p>
          <p>
            Stephen - While the skills required to seem extensive, and may require a lot of training and courses to perfect 
            and grasp, especially in terms of the technical soft dev specific skills. It doesn't really change my mind on
            programming as the option for me, due to the fact that although it is intensive and demanding, it’ll keep me 
            occupied and busy, all the while providing me an in depth knowledge as to how IT systems work, and will evolve
            in future. </br></br>
            Daniel - I see Web and Front end development as a natural progression of my current skill set, so this is why 
            I chose this in the first place. I am surprised by its ranking as low as it did. I believe I had a good understanding 
            of the skill requirements before choosing this career path. I also think that depending on which organisation the 
            job is being offered in the choice can vary greatly in what is being asked of the position. In my ongoing study of 
            the IT profession I am recognising that the huge variety of options available and am open to following new paths and 
            there are a lot of interesting areas and exciting future careers available. </br></br>
            Ella - These skills and rankings actually confirm my desire to become a web developer. I enjoy web development because 
            I love how the creativity of designing the user interface and experience combines with the logic and technicality of 
            programming, however I have been unsure of it as a career choice due to the increasing availability of platforms such
            as Wordpress, Wix, and other similar website-building platforms. These allow people to build dynamic websites with 
            little-to-no programming ability, so I fear that being a web developer will become a far less in-demand.</br></br>
          </p>
          <h3>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
          <p>
            Basic SQL is one of the most demand IT specific skills making up almost 10% of the whole IT skills demand. 
            The next runner up is javascript and java which just like basic sql takes up a massive near 15% of  IT skills with SQL 
            making up one 4th of all demand. The next is Git which makes up roughly 2.7% of the whole skill demand. </br></br>
          </p>
          <h3>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to general skills the highest is communication skills by far due the fact that is the most general and 
            versatile skill in the modern workplace and is usable in every occupation causing communication skills too far out pace 
            any skill in the data set. The runner up with under half the demand of the previous skill is problem solving skills again 
            a very general and versatile skill in the modern workplace and is usable in every occupation. After that, writing skills 
            are the fourth highest general skill.</br></br>
          </p>
          <h3>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
          <p>
            The three highest demand IT skills not needed are Microsoft Windows, project management and S.A.P. We feel the reason 
            we do not need these skills despite their high demand is because this software is mostly used for careers in IT focusing 
            on business and financial management.</br></br>
          </p>
          <h3>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
          <p>
            The three highest-ranked general skills which are not in our skill set are teamwork at 5th, troubleshooting at 6th, and
            planning in 7th.

        <h2>IT Work</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Our group interviewed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/malcolm-watts-12208214/?originalSubdomain=au">Malcolm Watts</a>, 
            who currently works in ICT and as an implementation partner.</br></p>
          <h3>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>
          <p>
            For most of his clients, Malcolm serves as their IT department, helping with any day-to-day troubleshooting, 
            as well as setting up computers, systems and networks. He considers himself a ‘jack-of-all-trades’ when it 
            comes to his work - doing anything from replacing IT equipment to implementing clients’ software systems. 
            He does a lot of work setting up machines (hardware management) - this involves both the physical set up, 
            and researching the systems and technology for his clients. He also does network maintenance - especially in 
            the current situation with Covid-19, he is having to ensure that all his clients have remote access to files, 
            servers and programs to be able to work from home. This involves setting up VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) 
            and managing credentials for individual access to these networks. Malcolm says that personally, he finds himself 
            doing very little scripting in his current position, however he is looking at automating some of the work he is 
            doing currently for clients.</br></br>
            A lesser aspect of his work is also working on some projects, including a timesheet management program that his 
            company developed. This project involves a lot of design work - system architecture and user-experience design. 
            Running the program also involves designing databases and data structures.</br></br>
          </p>
          <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? </br>
            Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h3>
          <p>Malcolm has a small company, so aside from the few IT professionals within his company, he interacts mostly with 
            clients. These are generally professional services providers - for example, he has done work for several 
            environmental management companies. Since he works mostly with clients, he doesn’t have any significant degree of 
            interaction with the general public.</br></br>
            Previously, when the company’s biggest project - the timesheet program - was in early development, he also worked 
            with a company who was sponsoring the program, however he doesn’t work much with investors at the moment.</br></br>
          </p>
          <h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>
          <p>
            Malcolm spends his time split between the shared office space and clients’ offices. He also will often have to do 
            work at home, which is possible both because he runs a small company and much of the work he does is very feasible 
            to do remotely. Some days, Malcolm will go to the office, and then continue work at home. Generally, his days with 
            clients are set each week, however he may have to go to their offices at other times if there is an urgent issue 
            or a large change. One example for this is that he flew to a client’s office in Sydney recently because they were 
            undergoing major changes to their system which he had to oversee.</br></br>
          </p>
          <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
          <p>
            The aspect of his position which he finds the most challenging is administration tasks such as invoicing, 
            timesheets and accounting. Another thing that he finds difficult is sales and marketing - he learned that as a 
            small IT company, you need more than just IT professionals; you need someone who will help attract clients and customers.
            </br></br>Malcolm also says that he finds that, when working with non-IT professionals, you need to maintain good 
            interpersonal skills, as people can become very stressed or upset when their systems aren’t working properly and 
            they can’t complete their own work. He finds that he has had to develop the ability to stay very calm and level-headed 
            when his clients are potentially very angry or upset. </br></br>
          </p>
          <h3>An example of the work the IT professional does that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h3>
          <p>
            Malcolm says that for him, this would have to be implementing a hybrid environment for a company that uses large data 
            sets, and has distributed users (i.e. spread across multiple offices, cities or countries). He says the steps to this are: </br>
            <ul>
              <li>Defining the issue that needs a solution.</li>
              <li>Choosing or researching potential solutions which will fulfill the requirements of the company.</li>
              <li>Understanding the complexities of each of the potential solutions, such as set-up costs, maintenance requirements 
                and the limitations of the business resources such as their budget.</li>
              <li>Creating a proposal for the company based on your recommendations as the IT professional, outlining the strengths 
                and weaknesses of the various approaches.</li>
              <li>There is the potential for a trail phase - if possible, you may have access to trial software systems or hardware.</li>
              <li>Once approved, moving to an implementation phase, which firstly involves designing a set up approach.</li>
              <li>Then, acquiring resources, which could be cloud services or physical equipment.</li>
              <li>Building and running a pilot program, which typically involves a small number of people to iron out any bugs - a 
                small test-run within the business. Then fixing any issues that may be found.</li>
              <li>Change management - making sure that the company’s employees know what’s happening and what adjustments they will 
                need to make to be able to use the new systems (including training employees in the new system).</li>
              <li>Implementing the system across the whole company - depending on the size of the company, this might happen in one 
                go, it might be staged, or it might be on an as-needed basis.</li>
              <li>From there on, there will also be system maintenance.</li>
            </ul>
            </br>Malcolm says that the people who may be involved with a job like this are a project manager, user liaison, the 
            client themselves, technical staff (ICT professionals, network professionals, database experts), and help-desk staff, among others.
            </br></br>He also made note that since the IT industry is quite broad, he feels that many IT professionals would have different 
            perspectives for this question, as there are many aspects to the IT industry.

        <h2>IT Technologies</h2>
        <h2 class="nobox tophead">Machine Learning</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of accepted definitions, Machine Learning is defined as the ability for machines to automatically improve through
            the experience of the task it was designed for, ultimately it is a form of artificial intelligence. Machine learning isn't
            a new term within the IT industry, it has been worked on and referenced since the early 1950’s when inventors attempted to
            produce machines such as the Perceptron (which is one of the first machines capable of learning), a machine designed to
            model how the human brain processes visual data, and was capable of identifying objects. </br></br>
            And while machine learning has come a long way since it’s initial implementation through ANN’s (Artificial Neural Networks), there hasn't been many advancements
            to it since the 2010's introduced a more wider use of deep learning. Due to the fact that IT professionals discovered a way 
            to more easily train those Deep Neural Networks which relied on the deep learning algorithm. However, in recent years an
            application of machine learning has been expanded, with GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) tech being updated and 
            modernised to a point in which the neural networks can be fed a larger sample size of data and information compared to its
            predecessors, this is also known ironically as BigGAN. </br></br>
            Currently, Machine Learning is used in a vast majority of the professional fields around the world, ranging from medical all the way to advertisement and media, with its current objective
            to inter/extrapolate information about consumers or events (basically predicting) pertaining to the data it is fed depending
            on the information provided. For example, ANN’s within banks can allow bankers to monitor and assist in providing a more 
            tailored assistance to loans and savings options, or in terms of media, a more direct and personalised advertorial within an
            online shopping environment, meaning that users would see the items they might be more interested in… again providing a more
            tailored and custom experience. But that isn't all machine learning can do, and those examples provided above only detail a 
            small section of its involvement within businesses today, and an even smaller aspect of its roles within societies in future.
            Besides the obvious improvements to performance and outputs by the ANN due to an increase in computer specs and the amount of
            input data accumulated/ received over the years of it running. One of its potential roles within the not so distant future 
            includes the automation of certain aspect of our lives and careers, with ANN’s possibly becoming more useful in things like
            automated item ordering for stores based on weekly sales (Coles currently uses a version of this which is being taught how to
            order certain item for areas such as the Deli). Or even in the far future, RPA (Robotic Process Automation) using machine 
            learning, which is the automation of basic jobs like librarians and clerks using artificial intelligence trained on the inputs
            of human behaviour during certain instances (e.g. scanning items, packaging items, putting the correct series of button inputs
            based on a specific task, etc). The automation of tasks described earlier could be possible within the next few years due to 
            the fast expansion and growth of automated machine learning, which means that the input data doesn't have to be added through
            human intervention, and outputs/ solutions don't have to be drawn through human intervention, but can be concluded by the ANN
            itself. Allowing human resources to be focused on more important areas. Even now the A. ANN is and can be used to some degree
            as technology currently exists, such as:
             Cloud AutoML - A set of cloud based machine learning products which allows the independent training of ANNs to happen, even if the user
            doesn't have all that much experience.
            ATM (Auto Tune Models) - Multi-data system for automated machine learning.
          </p>
          <h3>What is it's likely Impact?</h3>
          <p>
            As I briefly touched upon with the ‘What does it Do?’ section of this technology, i stated that in future these automated machine
            learning ANN’s would be able to take over certain industrial jobs though RPA (Robotic Process Automation). Which to summarise is
            the process of an ANN completing predictions and using/ obtaining/interpreting inputs without the need for human input (but the
            machine MUST be somewhat configured prior with test data). </br></br>
            Eventually when a system such as this finally becomes more proficient and powerful (processing power wise), some jobs that require
            human resources can be taken over/ automated. Some jobs like this includes but are not limited to Cashiers, Librarians, Warehouse
            and Manufacturing jobs, etc. This automation, although a great step toward the future can create a lot of social complications as
            humans become redundant in certain aspects of jobs meaning that unemployment would become a big problem within future years as 
            there would be a smaller job pool in which people could apply and work.
          </p>
          <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
          <p>
            If automated machine learning were to become the norm, and take over some commercial work effective immediately, it would
            render my job as a Coles employee useless and I'd receive no compensation as I'm a casual. However besides me, my immediate family
            would only be affected by the loss of a discount, and all of society would have to become accustomed to the new ways in which they 
            may have to purchase their goods.</br></br>
            However since that WON'T happen for at least another 5 - 10 years realistically, it provides employees specially the opportunity to
            find work, or adapt their position within the business allowing them to remain employed even when automation seizes their position.
            This time frame also allows the consumers, shareholders/ investors, and most importantly the company itself the necessary time to
            allow the automation to become fully incorporated seamlessly (the business), and for consumers the ability to adapt to the new way in
            which they may need to become accustomed to when purchasing dometic goods.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="nobox">Cyber Security</h2>
          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>
            Cyber Security is often described or referred to as [1] the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks,
            devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. Cyber security (CS) has always been a major aspect of IT 
            innovation, however its relevance within society nowadays has grown exponentially, as more and more people have moved to the web with
            their personal information at a risk to intrusion and corruption by those with malicious intent. While this area of information
            technology is fast developing, the transformation of ideas on how to best protect personal and private info has changed significantly.
            With the state of the art tech from 2018 being heavily influenced by ideas such as a better [2] ‘End to End Encryption’ of personal
            info when exchanging info, in which both users rely on primary keys (password for password locked information) to access the encrypted 
            information. Or something such as [2] ‘Single Use Softwares’, which is used in-order to protect purchasable, intellectual property 
            that in the past would be pirated. Which to briefly sum up involves the use of quantum computers to build single use software tools 
            from light particles, in the attempt to prevent intellectual property such as code from being pirated, or a malicious attack. Whilst
            in modern times, the latest and greatest within tech development involves the use of AI and the automation of data collection. This new
            era of automation, especially within the realm of CS could potentially redesign the way info is stored, shared and protected, as 
            processes won't be controlled with the potential of human error. Rather controlled with precision based on the events the AI is taught
            to protect against. Some fantastic examples of this include the [3] use of AI’s in the defence and attacking of threats against 
            companies' internet processes. These AI can be taught to defend the information and user from things such as [4] phishing links, 
            eavesdropping malware, harmful downloads with SQL injections, etc, protecting the user and their processes online by almost 
            instantaneously protecting the companies/individuals systems once irregular action is taken. Another example involves the use of 
            ANN and ML to not only complete certain tasks such as data collection faster, but free up the companies employees, reducing workload
            on maintenance (still required but less involved as the ANN can be taught to suspend data collection when malicious malware is 
            detected). In future, these automated processes can be refined to not only act based upon the tests data and actions it is coded to
            protect against, but possibly be developed in such a way that it can adapt and learn in real time to produce a greater protection of
            the companies/ organisations/ users sensitive information (so basically proper artificial intelligence which can learn new ways of
            data protection based on the experience it has during its professional use).
          </p>
          <h3>What is it's likely impact?</h3>
          <p>
            If AI and ML becomes the forefront of CS within an online system, it WILL redefine the standards for which IT professionals and companies
            need to meet inorder to be considered secure. As while AI and ML can be used to streamline processes for data collection and  become able
            to shut down the potential for malicious intrusion by hackers, this access to a smarter, more capable AI system will lead to hackers 
            producing AI and ANN’s of their own in pursuit of data stealing and hacking. HOWEVER, this is currently only a presumption, as tech like 
            this will need time for development to become even remotely capable of completing the tasks it's needed for. But, if we pretend that tech
            like this were to be implemented right now, tech like this would affect almost all large corporations and businesses, as the demand for 
            CS technicians capable of maintaining the AI, but also finding new work for the employees tasked with the jobs that were monitored by 
            the employees. This automation (if introduced right now or even implemented in future) could cause the possibility of mass job loss, as
            employers will only need specialist roles such as technicians to maintain the AI and ANN used to process and secure the workplaces info,
            but this can also be portrayed as businesses and corporation may call for the need of individuals in the marketing, once again creating 
            new jobs. This kind of automation wouldn't be a cause for concern in terms of job and skill redundancy, rather a little push as to 
            promote more creative skills (marketing) and technical skills when pursuing work within an IT profession (less people in certain aspects
            of a job) or any profession at that.
          </p>
          <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
          <p>
            Innovation such as the one mentioned above (automation of CS) while ground breaking in terms of its potential implications, won't really
            affect anyone including my team and I who currently work within hospitality and customer service based occupations. However, in future 
            its members such as Ella, Daniel and Stephen may need to develop technician based skills to assist IT companies in the protection and
            servicing of the AI, and or be able to interpret the raw data accumulated from the ML algorithms in the collection of user, client,
            etc data. As human resources within the areas of data protection and collection will no longer be considered paramount in the survival
            of data attacks/theft, rather the servicing and protection of those AI will be considered the pinnacle of CS.
