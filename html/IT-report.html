        <div class="paragraph">
          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of accepted definitions, Machine Learning is defined as the ability for machines to automatically improve through
            the experience of the task it was designed for, ultimately it is a form of artificial intelligence. Machine learning isn't
            a new term within the IT industry, it has been worked on and referenced since the early 1950’s when inventors attempted to
            produce machines such as the Perceptron (which is one of the first machines capable of learning), a machine designed to
            model how the human brain processes visual data, and was capable of identifying objects. </br></br>
            And while machine learning has come a long way since it’s initial implementation through ANN’s (Artificial Neural Networks), there hasn't been many advancements
            to it since the 2010's introduced a more wider use of deep learning. Due to the fact that IT professionals discovered a way 
            to more easily train those Deep Neural Networks which relied on the deep learning algorithm. However, in recent years an
            application of machine learning has been expanded, with GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) tech being updated and 
            modernised to a point in which the neural networks can be fed a larger sample size of data and information compared to its
            predecessors, this is also known ironically as BigGAN. </br></br>
            Currently, Machine Learning is used in a vast majority of the professional fields around the world, ranging from medical all the way to advertisement and media, with its current objective
            to inter/extrapolate information about consumers or events (basically predicting) pertaining to the data it is fed depending
            on the information provided. For example, ANN’s within banks can allow bankers to monitor and assist in providing a more 
            tailored assistance to loans and savings options, or in terms of media, a more direct and personalised advertorial within an
            online shopping environment, meaning that users would see the items they might be more interested in… again providing a more
            tailored and custom experience. But that isn't all machine learning can do, and those examples provided above only detail a 
            small section of its involvement within businesses today, and an even smaller aspect of its roles within societies in future.
            Besides the obvious improvements to performance and outputs by the ANN due to an increase in computer specs and the amount of
            input data accumulated/ received over the years of it running. One of its potential roles within the not so distant future 
            includes the automation of certain aspect of our lives and careers, with ANN’s possibly becoming more useful in things like
            automated item ordering for stores based on weekly sales (Coles currently uses a version of this which is being taught how to
            order certain item for areas such as the Deli). Or even in the far future, RPA (Robotic Process Automation) using machine 
            learning, which is the automation of basic jobs like librarians and clerks using artificial intelligence trained on the inputs
            of human behaviour during certain instances (e.g. scanning items, packaging items, putting the correct series of button inputs
            based on a specific task, etc). The automation of tasks described earlier could be possible within the next few years due to 
            the fast expansion and growth of automated machine learning, which means that the input data doesn't have to be added through
            human intervention, and outputs/ solutions don't have to be drawn through human intervention, but can be concluded by the ANN
            itself. Allowing human resources to be focused on more important areas. Even now the A. ANN is and can be used to some degree
            as technology currently exists, such as:
     Cloud AutoML - A set of cloud based machine learning products which allows the independent training of ANNs to happen, even if the user
            doesn't have all that much experience.
    ATM (Auto Tune Models) - Multi-data system for automated machine learning.
          </p>
          <h3>What is it's likely Impact?</h3>
          <p>
            As I briefly touched upon with the ‘What does it Do?’ section of this technology, i stated that in future these automated machine
            learning ANN’s would be able to take over certain industrial jobs though RPA (Robotic Process Automation). Which to summarise is
            the process of an ANN completing predictions and using/ obtaining/interpreting inputs without the need for human input (but the
            machine MUST be somewhat configured prior with test data). </br></br>
            Eventually when a system such as this finally becomes more proficient and powerful (processing power wise), some jobs that require
            human resources can be taken over/ automated. Some jobs like this includes but are not limited to Cashiers, Librarians, Warehouse
            and Manufacturing jobs, etc. This automation, although a great step toward the future can create a lot of social complications as
            humans become redundant in certain aspects of jobs meaning that unemployment would become a big problem within future years as 
            there would be a smaller job pool in which people could apply and work.
          </p>
          <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
          <p>
            If automated machine learning were to become the norm, and take over some commercial work effective immediately, it would
            render my job as a Coles employee useless and I'd receive no compensation as I'm a casual. However besides me, my immediate family
            would only be affected by the loss of a discount, and all of society would have to become accustomed to the new ways in which they 
            may have to purchase their goods.</br></br>
            However since that WON'T happen for at least another 5 - 10 years realistically, it provides employees specially the opportunity to
            find work, or adapt their position within the business allowing them to remain employed even when automation seizes their position.
            This time frame also allows the consumers, shareholders/ investors, and most importantly the company itself the necessary time to
            allow the automation to become fully incorporated seamlessly (the business), and for consumers the ability to adapt to the new way in
            which they may need to become accustomed to when purchasing dometic goods.

          <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>
            Cyber Security is often described or referred to as [1] the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks,
            devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. Cyber security (CS) has always been a major aspect of IT 
            innovation, however its relevance within society nowadays has grown exponentially, as more and more people have moved to the web with
            their personal information at a risk to intrusion and corruption by those with malicious intent. While this area of information
            technology is fast developing, the transformation of ideas on how to best protect personal and private info has changed significantly.
            With the state of the art tech from 2018 being heavily influenced by ideas such as a better [2] ‘End to End Encryption’ of personal
            info when exchanging info, in which both users rely on primary keys (password for password locked information) to access the encrypted 
            information. Or something such as [2] ‘Single Use Softwares’, which is used in-order to protect purchasable, intellectual property 
            that in the past would be pirated. Which to briefly sum up involves the use of quantum computers to build single use software tools 
            from light particles, in the attempt to prevent intellectual property such as code from being pirated, or a malicious attack. Whilst
            in modern times, the latest and greatest within tech development involves the use of AI and the automation of data collection. This new
            era of automation, especially within the realm of CS could potentially redesign the way info is stored, shared and protected, as 
            processes won't be controlled with the potential of human error. Rather controlled with precision based on the events the AI is taught
            to protect against. Some fantastic examples of this include the [3] use of AI’s in the defence and attacking of threats against 
            companies' internet processes. These AI can be taught to defend the information and user from things such as [4] phishing links, 
            eavesdropping malware, harmful downloads with SQL injections, etc, protecting the user and their processes online by almost 
            instantaneously protecting the companies/individuals systems once irregular action is taken. Another example involves the use of 
            ANN and ML to not only complete certain tasks such as data collection faster, but free up the companies employees, reducing workload
            on maintenance (still required but less involved as the ANN can be taught to suspend data collection when malicious malware is 
            detected). In future, these automated processes can be refined to not only act based upon the tests data and actions it is coded to
            protect against, but possibly be developed in such a way that it can adapt and learn in real time to produce a greater protection of
            the companies/ organisations/ users sensitive information (so basically proper artificial intelligence which can learn new ways of
            data protection based on the experience it has during its professional use).
          </p>
          </h3>What is it's likely impact?</h3>
          </p>
            If AI and ML becomes the forefront of CS within an online system, it WILL redefine the standards for which IT professionals and companies
            need to meet inorder to be considered secure. As while AI and ML can be used to streamline processes for data collection and  become able
            to shut down the potential for malicious intrusion by hackers, this access to a smarter, more capable AI system will lead to hackers 
            producing AI and ANN’s of their own in pursuit of data stealing and hacking. HOWEVER, this is currently only a presumption, as tech like 
            this will need time for development to become even remotely capable of completing the tasks it's needed for. But, if we pretend that tech
            like this were to be implemented right now, tech like this would affect almost all large corporations and businesses, as the demand for 
            CS technicians capable of maintaining the AI, but also finding new work for the employees tasked with the jobs that were monitored by 
            the employees. This automation (if introduced right now or even implemented in future) could cause the possibility of mass job loss, as
            employers will only need specialist roles such as technicians to maintain the AI and ANN used to process and secure the workplaces info,
            but this can also be portrayed as businesses and corporation may call for the need of individuals in the marketing, once again creating 
            new jobs. This kind of automation wouldn't be a cause for concern in terms of job and skill redundancy, rather a little push as to 
            promote more creative skills (marketing) and technical skills when pursuing work within an IT profession (less people in certain aspects
            of a job) or any profession at that.
          </p>
          <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
          <p>
            Innovation such as the one mentioned above (automation of CS) while ground breaking in terms of its potential implications, won't really
            affect anyone including my team and I who currently work within hospitality and customer service based occupations. However, in future 
            its members such as Ella, Daniel and Stephen may need to develop technician based skills to assist IT companies in the protection and
            servicing of the AI, and or be able to interpret the raw data accumulated from the ML algorithms in the collection of user, client,
            etc data. As human resources within the areas of data protection and collection will no longer be considered paramount in the survival
            of data attacks/theft, rather the servicing and protection of those AI will be considered the pinnacle of CS.
