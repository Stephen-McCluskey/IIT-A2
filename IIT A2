    <p>
      I’m Ella (s3851446), and I’ve lived in Brisbane, Queensland for most of my life. One of my hobbies is learning languages - 
      I have reached an intermediate level in French, and I am looking at learning Dutch next. 
      I am interested in IT because I enjoy problem solving and using logic-based thinking skills, but I am also attracted to the creativity 
      that is required in some IT roles. However, I have very little IT experience outside of this course - I have only done 
      some basic HTML, CSS and javascript with Codecademy, as well as an introductory R course during a previous degree.

    <h2>Team Profile</h2>
    <p>
      Myers-Briggs Test indicated that William is INTP, and Stephen, Ella and Daniel are INFP. </br></br>
      Our individually chosen tests give interesting results, William scored predominantly extroverted, open and neurotic on the 5 personalities test. 
      Stephen scored 6-7/10 on a psychometrics test. Ella scored left-leaning libertarian on the political compass test. 
      Daniel is logical and analytical whilst being practical and an empathic idealist.</br></br>
      In terms of our Myers-Briggs personality types, we all have very similar personalities (either INTP or INFP). 
      This should work well for group cohesion as we all have fairly mild personality types. The only issue this may pose is that there could be strengths that we are lacking as a group. 
      Majority of our group members (Stephen, William and Daniel) are visual learners, which is a great advantage when it comes to working online. 
      Having a tactile learning style (Ella) will come at a disadvantage as there is less opportunity to interact with things when writing reports, 
      however this disadvantage should be mitigated by the group. </br></br>
      In terms of our third online test, William’s personality test again outlines strengths that will be useful for group work (openness and extrovertedness). 
      Stephen’s 6-7/10 for the psychometrics test suggests quite a good aptitude for group work. Daniel’s results as logical and practical should help with meeting task requirements, 
      and his empathetic result means he is likely to be a cooperative group member. Ella’s political compass quiz is less illustrative for group work,
      as political / idealistic leaning should not really be considered when writing a report, however it would be ideal if the group could manage political views to work cohesively.
