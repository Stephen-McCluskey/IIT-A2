        <p>
          The members of VibeCheck are Stephen Mccluskey, William Scott, Ella Watts and Daniel Zaknic. 
          We're Group 2 from Introduction to Information Technology, and this is our page for Assignment 2.</p>
        <p>
          I’m <a href="https://stephen-mccluskey.github.io/Profile/">Stephen (s3855458)</a> and I’ve lived in Australia since 2008 when I moved here with my family from South Africa. 
          My main hobbies are in gaming and fitness as it’s fun and distracting/involving. 
          I’m interested in IT as I wish to understand how the game developers use coding to produce the final outcome of a game, 
          as one day I'd like to be able to produce my own games and programs capable of completing tasks. 
          However currently I don't really have that much experience in coding besides python, visual basics and a little bit of Javascript. 
          But intend to further my knowledge over the length of this and other courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m <a href="https://winikari.github.io/Assignment-1/">William (s3851536)</a> and I have always been interested in IT from a young age and due to the fact that I grew up in a generation that is
          surrounded by modern consumer electronics the modern internet and modern social media and the cultural shift that came about with 
          all of these things hitting the mainstream, it was about 5 or 6 when I started building PCS mainly just so I could play video games 
          but as I grew up the power of I.T really started to awe and terrify me, tales like a deep learning A.I 
          that can tell what products you want before you want or single man-made program that after being fed the right data and variables 
          was able to perfectly predict the winners on the track at the Hong Kong horse racers. when it comes to experiences well I’ve never 
          had the opportunity to become formally trained until now therefore I am completely self-taught.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m <a href="https://ellawatts-rmit.github.io/">Ella (s3851446)</a>, and I’ve lived in Brisbane, Queensland for most of my life. One of my hobbies is learning languages - 
          I have reached an intermediate level in French, and I am looking at learning Dutch next. 
          I am interested in IT because I enjoy problem solving and using logic-based thinking skills, but I am also attracted to the creativity 
          that is required in some IT roles. However, I have very little IT experience outside of this course - I have only done 
          some basic HTML, CSS and javascript with Codecademy, as well as an introductory R course during a previous degree. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am <a href="https://dzak77.github.io/Assignment1-DZ/">Daniel (s3858822)</a> and I live in Adelaide, South Australia. I lived in the UK for 3 years, spending 6 months on the 
          Isle of Wight and the rest of the time in Liverpool. I love football (soccer) and I am lost without it at the moment. 
          I am interested in the visual arts, pop culture, games, history and economics. Sometimes I think I am interested in too 
          many things. I have a professional background in Printing and Graphic Arts and have seen the web take over the industry. 
          I have needed to start to understand IT and start to code HTML, CSS, Google Ads and Flash, this has been highly enjoyable 
          for me. So I chose this as the direction I want to go next professionally.

      <h2>Team Profile</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Myers-Briggs Test indicated that William is INTP, and Stephen, Ella and Daniel are INFP. </br></br>
        Our individually chosen tests give interesting results, William scored predominantly extroverted, open and neurotic on the 5 personalities test. 
        Stephen scored 6-7/10 on a psychometrics test. Ella scored left-leaning libertarian on the political compass test. 
        Daniel is logical and analytical whilst being practical and an empathic idealist.</br></br>
        In terms of our Myers-Briggs personality types, we all have very similar personalities (either INTP or INFP). 
        This should work well for group cohesion as we all have fairly mild personality types. The only issue this may pose is that there could be strengths that we are lacking as a group. 
        Majority of our group members (Stephen, William and Daniel) are visual learners, which is a great advantage when it comes to working online. 
        Having a tactile learning style (Ella) will come at a disadvantage as there is less opportunity to interact with things when writing reports, 
        however this disadvantage should be mitigated by the group. </br></br>
        In terms of our third online test, William’s personality test again outlines strengths that will be useful for group work (openness and extrovertedness). 
        Stephen’s 6-7/10 for the psychometrics test suggests quite a good aptitude for group work. Daniel’s results as logical and practical should help with meeting task requirements, 
        and his empathetic result means he is likely to be a cooperative group member. Ella’s political compass quiz is less illustrative for group work,
        as political / idealistic leaning should not really be considered when writing a report, however it would be ideal if the group could manage political views to work cohesively. 
      </p>

    <div class="sect" id="jobs">
      <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        When it comes to the ideal jobs of each person there are very few commonalities and the ones that there are not very interesting - mainly that we all focus on a form of development, 
        whether it be for end-user experience, company security or scientific application. The interesting part - the difference, as hinted at in that sentence - is the different 
        organisations we wish to work for and who we wish our products to be for; from consumer oriented to academically oriented, case in point.</br></br>
        Ella and Daniel are very interested in the development and maintenance of end user design and interface managing code that runs the user-facing side of the sites and show desire 
        to work in a more client and customer dictated role.</br></br>
        William wishes to work in a more academic role far away from the demands and requests of clients and end users wishing to focus on creative invention.</br></br>
        Stephen sits in the middle of the paradigm with the wish to work with clients with the relative freedom and direction in how the solution is created to avoid tiresome or monotonous work.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="sect" id="tools">
      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        For working on this assignment, our group used two main collaboration tools. For writing the report, we used Google Docs, 
        where we could all contribute to the report content. We found this to be a good solution for making a shared document. 
        For discussion and team meetings, we used Discord, which allows us to chat and message, so we could have group discussions 
        while also filling out our document at the same time. </br></br>
        The shared GitHub repository is useful however our changes only reflect how we migrated individual contributions to the profile section. 
        Ella was responsible for more of the html as that was one of her strengths, however the rest of the group contributed more to 
        other sections of the report - essentially, we allocated tasks and roles based on individual strengths, rather than trying to have each member do a little bit of every single section. 
        This means that our commit repository’s activity log, while still somewhat representative, does not form an entirely comprehensive picture of our group contributions.</br></br>

        Stephen - While the skills required to seem extensive, and may require a lot of training and courses to perfect 
        and grasp, especially in terms of the technical soft dev specific skills. It doesn't really change my mind on
        programming as the option for me, due to the fact that although it is intensive and demanding, it’ll keep me 
        occupied and busy, all the while providing me an in depth knowledge as to how IT systems work, and will evolve

      <h2>IT Technologies</h2>
      <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
      <h3>What does it do?</h3>
      <p>
        In terms of accepted definitions, Machine Learning is defined as the ability for machines to automatically improve through
        the experience of the task it was designed for, ultimately it is a form of artificial intelligence. Machine learning isn't
        a new term within the IT industry, it has been worked on and referenced since the early 1950’s when inventors attempted to
        produce machines such as the Perceptron (which is one of the first machines capable of learning), a machine designed to
        model how the human brain processes visual data, and was capable of identifying objects. </br></br>
        And while machine learning has come a long way since it’s initial implementation through ANN’s (Artificial Neural Networks), there hasn't been many advancements
        to it since the 2010's introduced a more wider use of deep learning. Due to the fact that IT professionals discovered a way 
        to more easily train those Deep Neural Networks which relied on the deep learning algorithm. However, in recent years an
        application of machine learning has been expanded, with GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) tech being updated and 
        modernised to a point in which the neural networks can be fed a larger sample size of data and information compared to its
        predecessors, this is also known ironically as BigGAN. </br></br>
        Currently, Machine Learning is used in a vast majority of the professional fields around the world, ranging from medical all the way to advertisement and media, with its current objective
        to inter/extrapolate information about consumers or events (basically predicting) pertaining to the data it is fed depending
        on the information provided. For example, ANN’s within banks can allow bankers to monitor and assist in providing a more 
        tailored assistance to loans and savings options, or in terms of media, a more direct and personalised advertorial within an
        online shopping environment, meaning that users would see the items they might be more interested in… again providing a more
        tailored and custom experience. But that isn't all machine learning can do, and those examples provided above only detail a 
        small section of its involvement within businesses today, and an even smaller aspect of its roles within societies in future.
        Besides the obvious improvements to performance and outputs by the ANN due to an increase in computer specs and the amount of
        input data accumulated/ received over the years of it running. One of its potential roles within the not so distant future 
        includes the automation of certain aspect of our lives and careers, with ANN’s possibly becoming more useful in things like
        automated item ordering for stores based on weekly sales (Coles currently uses a version of this which is being taught how to
        order certain item for areas such as the Deli). Or even in the far future, RPA (Robotic Process Automation) using machine 
        learning, which is the automation of basic jobs like librarians and clerks using artificial intelligence trained on the inputs
        of human behaviour during certain instances (e.g. scanning items, packaging items, putting the correct series of button inputs
        based on a specific task, etc). The automation of tasks described earlier could be possible within the next few years due to 
        the fast expansion and growth of automated machine learning, which means that the input data doesn't have to be added through
        human intervention, and outputs/ solutions don't have to be drawn through human intervention, but can be concluded by the ANN
        itself. Allowing human resources to be focused on more important areas. Even now the A. ANN is and can be used to some degree
        as technology currently exists, such as:
 Cloud AutoML - A set of cloud based machine learning products which allows the independent training of ANNs to happen, even if the user
        doesn't have all that much experience.
ATM (Auto Tune Models) - Multi-data system for automated machine learning.
      </p>
      <h3>What is it's likely Impact?</h3>
      <p>
        As I briefly touched upon with the ‘What does it Do?’ section of this technology, i stated that in future these automated machine
        learning ANN’s would be able to take over certain industrial jobs though RPA (Robotic Process Automation). Which to summarise is
        the process of an ANN completing predictions and using/ obtaining/interpreting inputs without the need for human input (but the
        machine MUST be somewhat configured prior with test data). </br></br>
        Eventually when a system such as this finally becomes more proficient and powerful (processing power wise), some jobs that require
        human resources can be taken over/ automated. Some jobs like this includes but are not limited to Cashiers, Librarians, Warehouse
        and Manufacturing jobs, etc. This automation, although a great step toward the future can create a lot of social complications as
        humans become redundant in certain aspects of jobs meaning that unemployment would become a big problem within future years as 
        there would be a smaller job pool in which people could apply and work.
      </p>
      <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
      <p>
        If automated machine learning were to become the norm, and take over some commercial work effective immediately, it would
        render my job as a Coles employee useless and I'd receive no compensation as I'm a casual. However besides me, my immediate family
        would only be affected by the loss of a discount, and all of society would have to become accustomed to the new ways in which they 
        may have to purchase their goods.</br></br>
        However since that WON'T happen for at least another 5 - 10 years realistically, it provides employees specially the opportunity to
        find work, or adapt their position within the business allowing them to remain employed even when automation seizes their position.
        This time frame also allows the consumers, shareholders/ investors, and most importantly the company itself the necessary time to
        allow the automation to become fully incorporated seamlessly (the business), and for consumers the ability to adapt to the new way in
        which they may need to become accustomed to when purchasing dometic goods.

      <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
      <h3>What does it do?</h3>
      <p>
        Cyber Security is often described or referred to as [1] the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks,
        devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. Cyber security (CS) has always been a major aspect of IT 
        innovation, however its relevance within society nowadays has grown exponentially, as more and more people have moved to the web with
        their personal information at a risk to intrusion and corruption by those with malicious intent. While this area of information
        technology is fast developing, the transformation of ideas on how to best protect personal and private info has changed significantly.
        With the state of the art tech from 2018 being heavily influenced by ideas such as a better [2] ‘End to End Encryption’ of personal
        info when exchanging info, in which both users rely on primary keys (password for password locked information) to access the encrypted 
        information. Or something such as [2] ‘Single Use Softwares’, which is used in-order to protect purchasable, intellectual property 
        that in the past would be pirated. Which to briefly sum up involves the use of quantum computers to build single use software tools 
        from light particles, in the attempt to prevent intellectual property such as code from being pirated, or a malicious attack. Whilst
        in modern times, the latest and greatest within tech development involves the use of AI and the automation of data collection. This new
        era of automation, especially within the realm of CS could potentially redesign the way info is stored, shared and protected, as 
        processes won't be controlled with the potential of human error. Rather controlled with precision based on the events the AI is taught
        to protect against. Some fantastic examples of this include the [3] use of AI’s in the defence and attacking of threats against 
        companies' internet processes. These AI can be taught to defend the information and user from things such as [4] phishing links, 
        eavesdropping malware, harmful downloads with SQL injections, etc, protecting the user and their processes online by almost 
        instantaneously protecting the companies/individuals systems once irregular action is taken. Another example involves the use of 
        ANN and ML to not only complete certain tasks such as data collection faster, but free up the companies employees, reducing workload
        on maintenance (still required but less involved as the ANN can be taught to suspend data collection when malicious malware is 
        detected). In future, these automated processes can be refined to not only act based upon the tests data and actions it is coded to
        protect against, but possibly be developed in such a way that it can adapt and learn in real time to produce a greater protection of
        the companies/ organisations/ users sensitive information (so basically proper artificial intelligence which can learn new ways of
        data protection based on the experience it has during its professional use).
      </p>
      </h3>What is it's likely impact?</h3>
      </p>
        If AI and ML becomes the forefront of CS within an online system, it WILL redefine the standards for which IT professionals and companies
        need to meet inorder to be considered secure. As while AI and ML can be used to streamline processes for data collection and  become able
        to shut down the potential for malicious intrusion by hackers, this access to a smarter, more capable AI system will lead to hackers 
        producing AI and ANN’s of their own in pursuit of data stealing and hacking. HOWEVER, this is currently only a presumption, as tech like 
        this will need time for development to become even remotely capable of completing the tasks it's needed for. But, if we pretend that tech
        like this were to be implemented right now, tech like this would affect almost all large corporations and businesses, as the demand for 
        CS technicians capable of maintaining the AI, but also finding new work for the employees tasked with the jobs that were monitored by 
        the employees. This automation (if introduced right now or even implemented in future) could cause the possibility of mass job loss, as
        employers will only need specialist roles such as technicians to maintain the AI and ANN used to process and secure the workplaces info,
        but this can also be portrayed as businesses and corporation may call for the need of individuals in the marketing, once again creating 
        new jobs. This kind of automation wouldn't be a cause for concern in terms of job and skill redundancy, rather a little push as to 
        promote more creative skills (marketing) and technical skills when pursuing work within an IT profession (less people in certain aspects
        of a job) or any profession at that.
      </p>
      <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
      <p>
        Innovation such as the one mentioned above (automation of CS) while ground breaking in terms of its potential implications, won't really
        affect anyone including my team and I who currently work within hospitality and customer service based occupations. However, in future 
        its members such as Ella, Daniel and Stephen may need to develop technician based skills to assist IT companies in the protection and
        servicing of the AI, and or be able to interpret the raw data accumulated from the ML algorithms in the collection of user, client,
        etc data. As human resources within the areas of data protection and collection will no longer be considered paramount in the survival
        of data attacks/theft, rather the servicing and protection of those AI will be considered the pinnacle of CS.
