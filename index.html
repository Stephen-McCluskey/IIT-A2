        <p>
          The members of VibeCheck are Stephen Mccluskey, William Scott, Ella Watts and Daniel Zaknic. 
          We're Group 2 from Introduction to Information Technology, and this is our page for Assignment 2.</p>
        <p>
          I’m <a href="https://stephen-mccluskey.github.io/Profile/">Stephen (s3855458)</a> and I’ve lived in Australia since 2008 when I moved here with my family from South Africa. 
          My main hobbies are in gaming and fitness as it’s fun and distracting/involving. 
          I’m interested in IT as I wish to understand how the game developers use coding to produce the final outcome of a game, 
          as one day I'd like to be able to produce my own games and programs capable of completing tasks. 
          However currently I don't really have that much experience in coding besides python, visual basics and a little bit of Javascript. 
          But intend to further my knowledge over the length of this and other courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m <a href="https://winikari.github.io/Assignment-1/">William (s3851536)</a> and I have always been interested in IT from a young age and due to the fact that I grew up in a generation that is
          surrounded by modern consumer electronics the modern internet and modern social media and the cultural shift that came about with 
          all of these things hitting the mainstream, it was about 5 or 6 when I started building PCS mainly just so I could play video games 
          but as I grew up the power of I.T really started to awe and terrify me, tales like a deep learning A.I 
          that can tell what products you want before you want or single man-made program that after being fed the right data and variables 
          was able to perfectly predict the winners on the track at the Hong Kong horse racers. when it comes to experiences well I’ve never 
          had the opportunity to become formally trained until now therefore I am completely self-taught.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m <a href="https://ellawatts-rmit.github.io/">Ella (s3851446)</a>, and I’ve lived in Brisbane, Queensland for most of my life. One of my hobbies is learning languages - 
          I have reached an intermediate level in French, and I am looking at learning Dutch next. 
          I am interested in IT because I enjoy problem solving and using logic-based thinking skills, but I am also attracted to the creativity 
          that is required in some IT roles. However, I have very little IT experience outside of this course - I have only done 
          some basic HTML, CSS and javascript with Codecademy, as well as an introductory R course during a previous degree. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am <a href="https://dzak77.github.io/Assignment1-DZ/">Daniel (s3858822)</a> and I live in Adelaide, South Australia. I lived in the UK for 3 years, spending 6 months on the 
          Isle of Wight and the rest of the time in Liverpool. I love football (soccer) and I am lost without it at the moment. 
          I am interested in the visual arts, pop culture, games, history and economics. Sometimes I think I am interested in too 
          many things. I have a professional background in Printing and Graphic Arts and have seen the web take over the industry. 
          I have needed to start to understand IT and start to code HTML, CSS, Google Ads and Flash, this has been highly enjoyable 
          for me. So I chose this as the direction I want to go next professionally.

      <h2>Team Profile</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Myers-Briggs Test indicated that William is INTP, and Stephen, Ella and Daniel are INFP. </br></br>
        Our individually chosen tests give interesting results, William scored predominantly extroverted, open and neurotic on the 5 personalities test. 
        Stephen scored 6-7/10 on a psychometrics test. Ella scored left-leaning libertarian on the political compass test. 
        Daniel is logical and analytical whilst being practical and an empathic idealist.</br></br>
        In terms of our Myers-Briggs personality types, we all have very similar personalities (either INTP or INFP). 
        This should work well for group cohesion as we all have fairly mild personality types. The only issue this may pose is that there could be strengths that we are lacking as a group. 
        Majority of our group members (Stephen, William and Daniel) are visual learners, which is a great advantage when it comes to working online. 
        Having a tactile learning style (Ella) will come at a disadvantage as there is less opportunity to interact with things when writing reports, 
        however this disadvantage should be mitigated by the group. </br></br>
        In terms of our third online test, William’s personality test again outlines strengths that will be useful for group work (openness and extrovertedness). 
        Stephen’s 6-7/10 for the psychometrics test suggests quite a good aptitude for group work. Daniel’s results as logical and practical should help with meeting task requirements, 
        and his empathetic result means he is likely to be a cooperative group member. Ella’s political compass quiz is less illustrative for group work,
        as political / idealistic leaning should not really be considered when writing a report, however it would be ideal if the group could manage political views to work cohesively.

      <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        When it comes to the ideal jobs of each person there are very few commonalities and the ones that there are not very interesting - mainly that we all focus on a form of development, 
        whether it be for end-user experience, company security or scientific application. The interesting part - the difference, as hinted at in that sentence - is the different 
        organisations we wish to work for and who we wish our products to be for; from consumer oriented to academically oriented, case in point.</br></br>
        Ella and Daniel are very interested in the development and maintenance of end user design and interface managing code that runs the user-facing side of the sites and show desire 
        to work in a more client and customer dictated role.</br></br>
        William wishes to work in a more academic role far away from the demands and requests of clients and end users wishing to focus on creative invention.</br></br>
        Stephen sits in the middle of the paradigm with the wish to work with clients with the relative freedom and direction in how the solution is created to avoid tiresome or monotonous work.

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        For working on this assignment, our group used two main collaboration tools. For writing the report, we used Google Docs, 
        where we could all contribute to the report content. We found this to be a good solution for making a shared document. 
        For discussion and team meetings, we used Discord, which allows us to chat and message, so we could have group discussions 
        while also filling out our document at the same time. </br></br>
        The shared GitHub repository is useful however our changes only reflect how we migrated individual contributions to the profile section. 
        Ella was responsible for more of the html as that was one of her strengths, however the rest of the group contributed more to 
        other sections of the report - essentially, we allocated tasks and roles based on individual strengths, rather than trying to have each member do a little bit of every single section. 
        This means that our commit repository’s activity log, while still somewhat representative, does not form an entirely comprehensive picture of our group contributions.</br></br>
